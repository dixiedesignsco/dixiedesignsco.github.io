        <b>WHAT ARE THE CURRENT PROCESSING TIMES?</b> <br>

        If you ordered customized items, your order will take between 10-14 business days to process.
        
        <b>BUSINESS DAYS ARE M-F (EXCLUDING MAJOR HOLIDAYS) AND START THE DAY AFTER YOU ORDER IS PLACED.</b>
        
        Ready To Ship items ship within 1-3 business days.
        Made To Order Item (Hair ties, State Stickers, etc ) have a 5-7 business day turnaround time.
        Rush orders ship within 1-3 business days.
        NOTE: Leaving a note during checkout that you need them faster does NOT count as a rush order. Rush processing incurs additional fees as our team works overtime to ensure they ship quickly.

    <b>HOW WILL I RECEIVE MY ORDER AFTER I ORDER?</b> <br>
        
        Your products will be delivered to the address that you gave at checkout. We ship via USPS. They will either go First Class or USPS Priority Mail. 

        <hr>
        
       <b> WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY ORDER? </b> <br>
        
        First Class Shipments - once shipped 3-5 business days
        
        USPS Priority Mail -  2-3 business days 
        
        <hr>

        <b> I ENTERED THE WRONG ADDRESS AT CHECKOUT. WHAT DO I DO? </b> <br>
        
        I recommend you double check your address while checking out so that you can receive your item on time. 
        
        BUT, if you did by mistake enter the wrong address, no worries. Please email me at DixieDesigns01@gmail.com with a screenshot of your receipt. I will be happy to change your address on my end. 
        
         <hr>
        
       <b> WHAT FORM OF PAYMENT DO YOU ACCEPT? </b> <br>
        
        We accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and other pay apps.
